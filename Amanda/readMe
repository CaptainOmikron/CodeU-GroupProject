The interesting file is the RearrangingCars.py. Don't worry if you don't know any python, it's really easy to read. I found a solution that's in O(N), which is decent. I can't imagine how you would achieve better time complexity, since you have to go through all cars at least once...

The second file is RearrangingCarsWithExperimentalComplexityAnalysis.py (haha). Don't read it unless you're super interested. It basically proves that the algorithm really is in O(N) by plotting runtimes for parking lots up to size 5000 and fitting a linear function to that.

I saved the result of this 'experimental complexity analysis' as Complexity.png. Have a look at it :)
